			<body>
				This is potentially the most dangerous spider in the United States with venom similar to that of rattlesnakes. It is tiny (1/2") and has a small violin-shaped mark on the head behind the eyes. The bite is rarely felt until 4-8 hours after, worsening 12-36 hours after. Some bites have a necrotizing ulcer that destroys soft tissue and may take months to heal. The tissue has potential to become gangrenous and slough away. Some victims have long-term debilities, pain, and impaired mobility

			<body>
				Call 911 immediately if you live in an area where these spiders are common and you suspect that you have been bitten. If possible, catch the specimen for confirmation. Some small spiders look similar to Brown Recluse but are not at all deadly
