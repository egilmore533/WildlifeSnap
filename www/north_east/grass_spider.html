				The Grass Spider is light brown in color, with darker brown stripes on its cephalothorax and its abdomen. Its body is slender and the male is 5/8 inch long. The female is 3/4 inch long and has very large rear spinnerets. It lives around grassy areas, stone fences, and small shrubs.

			</body>

			<body>
				Remove piles of bricks, firewood, and other debris that may serve as suitable homes for spiders or move them further from your home.Keep grassy or weedy areas near buildings cut short. Trim back shrubs and other plants that directly contact your home. Knock webs down with a broom or a hard spray of water. Remove and destroy any egg sacs or spiders that are found. Caulk or seal obvious cracks or spaces around the foundation, doors, and ground level windows. Check to be sure screens fit tightly. Replace any screens that fit poorly or are damaged.
