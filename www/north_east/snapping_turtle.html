				<p>FACTS</p>
			</body>

			<body>
				Length of 20 inches and weigh up to 35 pounds. Large head with a strong beak instead of teeth. The edges of the jaws have sharp edges. Long tail is armored by the dermal scales. The shell is a horny armor on the turtle shell. Aquatic most of the time, its feet are webbed and have four or five claws on each foot.

					<p>SAFETY</p>
			</body>

			<body>
				NEVER handle a snapping turtle by its tail. NEVER handle a large snapping turtle. Medium size snapping turtles should be held by the back of the shell or a hand on both sides of the shell (out of reach of the snapper).
