				Several color variations from bright copper and light brown to very dark brown shades. Newborns are colored and patterned like adults, except the last inch of the tail will be a bright yellow color. 2 to 4 feet in length, with thick, heavy bodies. Bite Symptoms Not usually fatal in adults, but very painful and often lasting discomfort. Symptoms include intense pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling, and severe nausea. Damage can occur to muscle and bone tissue, especially when the bite occurs in the outer extremities areas in which there is not a large muscle mass to absorb the venom.

				Clean up around the yard. Remove any trash. Replace any vegative garden mulch with gravel mulch, which will stop the snakes hiding in it. Be very careful when lifting any old logs or other trash that no snakes are lurking beneath them, a good pair of thick gloves, boots and thick jeans are a good precaution also
