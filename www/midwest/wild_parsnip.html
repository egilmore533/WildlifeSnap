				<p>FACTS</p>
			</body>

			<body>
				Plant secretes a severely irritating sap that absorbs into the skin on contact. Irritated, blistered, and peeling skin follows elongated streaks and spots that mimic the leaves and stems that the victim came in contact with Irritations generally will not appear until the area is exposed to direct light. Repeated and long exposure to the sap will result in small chemical burns. Burns will appear similar to poison ivy rashes
