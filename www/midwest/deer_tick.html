			<body>
				As with all insect bites, the area surrounding the bite will become itchy or inflamed. Ticks are particularly dangerous because they move from animal to animal to drink their blood. Some ticks carry Lyme, disease, Colorado tick fever, or Rocky Mountain tick fever. These are usually not fatal, but can pose serious hazards to health. Symptoms of Lyme disease include the tell-tale red bullseye mark. Further symptoms may not appear until years after the bite

				Ticks cannot jump, and usually lodge onto humans and animals that brush by plants where they nest. Common ways of removing a tick are: removing with tweezers, covering with clear nail polish, using heat from just-extinguished match, etc. When removing a tick, be sure that the head is entirely removed to ensure that the area will not be infected. Clean the bite area with antiseptic until redness disappears. Contact a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist
